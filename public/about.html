<p>My name is Abbas I am from Connecticut, I am a dedicated husband and a  father of two, I love to spend time with my family, 
  we love outdoor activities such hiking, playing soccer, pickle ball, walking, going to the beach, and raveling together</p>  

<p>I live in the New England region where I enjoy the four seasons, I love the fall season, I enjoy the cool weather, the changing colors.
